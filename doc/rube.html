<h1>RUBE</h1>

<p>Language version 1.5, revision 2012.0826.  Â©1997-2012 Cat's Eye Technologies.</p>

<h2>What is RUBE?</h2>

<p><dfn>RUBE</dfn> is a tribute to Rube Goldberg, creator of all those unique
cartoon contrivances, who showed the world that anything
can be done in a more complicated fashion than necessary.</p>

<p>The RUBE language is a "bully" cellular automaton: certain state
transitions force other, non-adjacent cells to assume certain state
transitions.  Although this may sound like an interesting notion, the
number of interactions climbs quickly as more objects are added, and
things get much messier than they normally would in a regular
cellular automaton, like John Conway's Game of Life.</p>

<p>Also unlike a real cellular automaton, RUBE supports rudimentary
output functionality; input was planned, but has not yet been implemented.</p>

<p>Because implementing an algorithm in RUBE is a clumsy job
of co-ordinating concurrently operating sections of the playfield, few
non-trivial RUBE programs exist.  In particular, it has never to the
author's knowledge been shown that RUBE is Turing-complete.
On the other hand, it has never been shown that it's not.</p>

<p>See <a href="rube.txt">rube.txt</a> for the original
description of the RUBE interpreter.  The only point that perhaps
needs clarification is that the limitation of the playfield to 80x25
is a limitation of the implementation, not of the language.
The language imposes no bounds on the size of a RUBE playfield.</p>
